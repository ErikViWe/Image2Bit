# Image2Bit
Image2Bit converts each pixel of an image to a 12 bit string. This project has been used for the technical computer science internship at the Karlsruhe Institut of Technology (KIT).
Following screenshot displays the main interface:

The converter will convert your image file to a text file containing each pixel of the image as 12 bit string.
All strings are seperated by a comma and the whole text is surrounded by brackets as this is the VHDL syntax for an array.
Here is a short example of how the output may look like:
("000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "111111111111", "111111111111", "111111111111", "111111111111", "111111111111", "111111111111", "111111111111", "111111111111", "111111111111", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "111111111111", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "111111111111", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000", "000000000000")

How to use Image2Bit:
1. Insert the link to your image which has a valid format (.jpg and .bmp are tested)
2. Press "Import" to load the image into the program. The image may be displayed different than it is. This is because the programm scales the image to 40x40 px.
3. Press "Convert" and it will generate and store the .txt file in the same directory and with the same name as the input image.
